# Qubika Club Administration — E2E Tests

This repository contains an end-to-end Playwright test that registers a test user, logs into the web app, and exercises category/subcategory flows.

Files of interest:
- [e2e/exercise2.e2e.spec.ts](e2e/exercise2.e2e.spec.ts) — contains the test [`Execute complete test E2E`](e2e/exercise2.e2e.spec.ts).
- [playwright.config.ts](playwright.config.ts) — Playwright configuration for the project.
- [package.json](package.json) — project scripts and dependencies.
- [credentials.json](credentials.json) — generated by the test at runtime with created user credentials.
- [.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json) — VS Code debug configuration.
- [.gitignore](.gitignore) — ignored files.

Overview of the test
- The test implemented in [e2e/exercise2.e2e.spec.ts](e2e/exercise2.e2e.spec.ts) registers a new user via API, saves payload to [credentials.json](credentials.json), opens the UI, logs in with the created user, then creates a category and a subcategory. See the test entry [`Execute complete test E2E`](e2e/exercise2.e2e.spec.ts) for the full flow.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (recommended latest LTS)
- npm or yarn

Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
2. Install Playwright browsers (required for UI runs):
```sh
npx playwright install
```

Running tests
- Run the single E2E spec:
```sh
npx playwright test e2e/exercise2.e2e.spec.ts
```
- Run the full test suite:
```sh
npx playwright test
```
- Run tests with headed browser and trace enabled (useful for debugging):
```sh
npx playwright test --headed --trace on
```

Common scripts (if present in package.json)
- npm test or npm run test — runs Playwright test suite
- npm run test:e2e — example alias for the e2e suite (check package.json to confirm)

Test artifacts and outputs
- credentials.json — created by the test when a user is registered. Contains email/password used by the UI portion of the test.
- Playwright traces, screenshots and videos (when enabled) are saved under the configured output directory (check playwright.config.ts).

Debugging in VS Code
- Use the configuration in [.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json) to run or debug tests from VS Code's Run and Debug pane.
- Use the integrated terminal to run the commands above and view Playwright output.

Tips & troubleshooting
- If login fails, inspect credentials.json to confirm the test-created credentials.
- If selectors fail, open the application manually and validate the current selectors / element IDs.
- Increase timeouts in playwright.config.ts if tests fail intermittently due to slow responses.
- Re-run `npx playwright install` after updating Playwright versions.

Cleaning up
- Remove or rotate credentials.json as needed to avoid leaking test accounts.
- If you need a fresh run, delete credentials.json and re-run the tests to generate a new account.

Contributing
- Edit tests under e2e/ and update playwright.config.ts for global settings.
- Add unit tests or additional E2E flows as needed and follow repo conventions.

License
- No license file included. Add LICENSE if needed.

Contact
- For local development questions, use the project's issue tracker or open a PR with proposed changes.
